# Whisper-ASR
**Description**
Whisper Fine-tuning: Adapt the powerful Whisper ASR model to new languages, accents, or specific audio domains by training on your local custom dataset. This process typically involves:

**Data Preparation**: Curating and preprocessing audio-text pairs from your local dataset.
**Model Loading**: Loading a pre-trained Whisper model as a base.
**Training**: Iteratively updating the model's parameters using your local custom data.
**Evaluation**: Assessing the fine-tuned model's performance on a held-out test set from your local data.
**Deployment** : Integrating the fine-tuned model into your application.
